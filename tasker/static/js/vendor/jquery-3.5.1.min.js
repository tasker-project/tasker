//	Implementation Summary
//
//	1. Enforce API surface and semantic compatibility with 1.9.x branch
//	2. Improve the module's maintainability by reducing the storage
//		paths to a single mechanism.
//	3. Use the same single mechanism to support "private" and "user" data.
//	4. _Never_ expose "private" data to user code (TODO: Drop _data, _removeData)
//	5. Avoid exposing implementation details on user objects (eg. expando properties)
//	6. Provide a clear path for implementation upgrade to WeakMap in 2014
